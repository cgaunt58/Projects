    <h1>Popularity</h1>
    <section class="fishtext">
        The channel catfish is neither federally listed nor imperiled. Channel catfish are a popular recreational ﬁsh and are
        managed by state recreational ﬁshing regulations through creel and size limits.
        Channel catfish, when introduced to non‐native waters, can negatively impact indigenous ﬁsh species because they are 
        such opportunistic feeders. They may eventually outcompete native ﬁshes for habitat and food.

<h1>Natural History</h1>
<section class="fishtext">Male channel catfish turn dark during spawning season and develop a thick pad on the top of their heads. Female channel
    catfish require cool water and short day lengths during the winter months for proper egg development. Channel catfish
    spawn, depending on the latitude, during the months of April through July, when temperatures reach 27 or 28 degrees Celsius (80‐82 degrees Fahrenheit).
    The spawning catfish pair will dig a depression on the bottom of the river or stream, or ﬁnd a suitable sub-surface cavity to
    deposit their eggs, which is then guarded by the male catfish. Egg incubation will last between 3 to 8 days, depending on the
    water temperature. Channel catfish larvae will take 12 to 16 days to develop.

    They are found within the central drainages of the United States.

<h1>Habitat</h1>
<section class="fishtext">
    Adult channel catfish inhabit rivers and streams. They prefer clean, well
    oxygenated waters, but can also live in ponds and reservoirs.

<br>
<h1>Diet</h1>
<section class="fishtext">
    Channel catfish feed primarily on small ﬁsh, crustaceans (crayﬁsh), clams and
    snails, aquatic insects and small mammals. There are even reports of channel catfish eating small birds.
