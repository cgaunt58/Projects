    <h1>Popularity</h1>
    <section class="fishtext">Black crappie are primarily a recreational ﬁsh and are managed through recreational ﬁshing regulations which may
        include, but not limited to season, bag/creel limits, size limits or water body. Another method for managing black crappie
        includes protecting their habitat. When Black crappie inhabit lakes, maintaining the proper predator/prey balance is
        essential to the sustainability of this species.

<h1>Natural History</h1>
<section class="fishtext">Black crappie are a freshwater species. They often form schools and feed early in the morning. Black crappie inhabit
    temperate waters. In the spring during spawning season, male crappie begin building nests by clearing sand, mud or gravel
    from the water bottom in preparation for the egg laying females to arrive. Upon their arrival, female crappie may spawn with
    diﬀerent males in more than one nest. Spawning involves the simultaneous extrusion of eggs by the females and milt by the
    males in the nests they had previously prepared before the female crappie had arrived at the spawning habitat. After
    spawning, male crappie guard the nest for approximately 5 days or until the juvenile crappie begin to emerge from their
    eggs and begin to feed.
